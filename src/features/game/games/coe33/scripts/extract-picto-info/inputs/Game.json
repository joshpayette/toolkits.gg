    "ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_House3_06": "No thanks.",
    "ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_ArenaRegistrar_08": "No worries though, I'll sign you up as a team. Just decide before each fight who gets the honour of getting beat up.",
    "ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Factory1_05": "No! It should attack Gestrals too so we can fight it!",
    "ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_HangingGestral_Father_01": "No!! My patate!!",
    "ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Bazar3_05": "No, I'll just stay here and look at your stuff.",

    "ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_House2_08": "Nope.",
    "ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Joust1_06": "Not everyone knows that, don't ruin the fun for them!",
    "ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Factory5_11": "Not that we eat Nevrons, of course. It is merely an expression.",
    "ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_VillageGates1_04": "Noted.",
    "ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Street4_03": "Nothing beats a good old fight to the death in the arena though.",
    "ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_GustaveInvention_Intro_05": "Now are you gonna help me or what?",
    "ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Golgra_24": "Now go away and hide in shame.",
    "ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Hunter_09": "Now go! Make your people proud for the day you return to Lumière!",
    "ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_ArenaRegistrar_21": "Now that the tournament's over, I must say, you guys are a lot more entertaining than I thought.",

    "ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_GustaveInvention_Intro_18": "Oh?",
    "ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Bazar1_05": "Oh? But what use do you have for Chroma?",
    "ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_GustaveInvention_Objective_03": "Ohhhhhh! You've got the mushroom!",
    "ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_ArenaRegistrar_07": "Oho, I appreciate the enthusiasm! Unfortunately, in the arena, it's one-on-one fights only.",
    "ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Noco_Revived_02": "Oh… hello.",
    "ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_VillageGates3_10": "Ok, time to go train. Like Golgra says, time spent yapping is time you could have spent TRAINING. Wish me luck!",

    "ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_ArenaRegistrar_01": "Registration for the tournament hasn't started yet. Come back later!",
    "ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Factory5_09": "Right!",

    "ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Factory2_03": "Shut up~",
    "ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Factory4_06": "Skool?",
    "ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Entrance3_04": "So I guess those were really dead Gestrals back there.",
    "ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_House7_03": "So I'll stand my ground, and pretend to be mad.",
    "ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_House4_09": "So about this previous expedition, you still don't remember their number?",
    "ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Infirmary1_16": "So don't tell me what I am.",
    "ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_House6_02": "So everybody wants me to go, is that it?!",
    "ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_ArenaRegistrar_03": "So far, we've got sign-ups from three of our legendary champions! And… a mysterious new warrior.",
    "ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Hunter_06": "So naturally, we wanted to fight them too. But many Gestrals have gotten squashed.",
    "ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Infirmary1_11": "So one day I decided, I don't want anyone to suffer the way I do.",
    "ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Hunter_11": "So, how's your hunt going?",
    "ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Joust1_01": "So, you guys up for some jousting?",

    "ST_D_MonocoStation_Training_03": "Oh, my achy bones. Yes, yes, you young folk have swayed my views. We must adopt the Gestral way. Alas, though my mind is in agreement, my body is recalcitrant.",

    "ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Result_02": "Poetic and magnificent.",
    "ST_D_MonocoStation_Worried_10": "Precisely. Our knowledge of the terrain and our skills at misdirection have allowed us to survive. To change course and provoke direct conflict is foolhardy.",

    "ST_D_MonocoStation_Sculptor_06": "So we did this.",
    "ST_D_MonocoStation_Training_10": "So. We are forced to meet them on their terms. Not with rhetoric. But with power.",
    "ST_D_MonocoStation_MerchantQuest_Standby_02": "Some can be found deep within the mountains of {levelName}.",

    "ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Result_06": "That did not flow.",

    "ST_D_MonocoStation_Historian_02": "That is great to hear. Do you write, then?",
    "ST_D_MonocoStation_FashionistQuest_Standby_04": "That is too bad. Maybe next time.",
    "ST_D_MonocoStation_Arguing_07": "That up there is the perfect vantage point. Had I stood watch from there, we would have had ample warning.",
    "ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Result_04": "That was not very poetic.",
    "ST_D_MonocoStation_FashionistQuest_Objective_04": "That was… quite terrible. Come back again after you have trained.",
    "ST_D_MonocoStation_Training_05": "The Gestrals have defended their home. They were never forced to flee. We must try the same. Monoco has shown us how to defeat them!",
    "ST_D_MonocoStation_Disapproving_01": "The Grandis lived peaceful lives long before the Paintress emerged.",
    "ST_D_MonocoStation_Weather_05": "The blizzards of yesteryear were a sight to behold… and quite invigorating to experience.",
    "ST_D_MonocoStation_Disapproving_05": "The debates were fierce and lengthy. I recall one bout that lasted 96 hours!",
    "ST_D_MonocoStation_Amazed_05": "The many wonders your ancestors have wrought.",
    "ST_D_MonocoStation_Scouts_03": "The object at the centre of the crater vanished some time ago. I wonder what it was?",

    "ST_D_MonocoStation_FashionistQuest_Standby_03": "Then let us commence.",
    "ST_D_MonocoStation_Worried_12": "There is much to ponder and no easy answers. But that is life, I suppose. Thank you for listening to my worries.",
    "ST_D_MonocoStation_Scouts_02": "There is too much we do not know about the crater. The Nevrons there are fierce.",
    "ST_D_MonocoStation_Sculptor_05": "There was a time when the tribes sought to compete in a different manner than through eloquence battles.",
    "ST_D_MonocoStation_FashionistQuest_Objective_03": "There. I am proud of this one.",
    "ST_D_MonocoStation_Sculptor_08": "They are from a time before the Nevrons… when we had the leisure to do as we pleased.",
    "ST_D_MonocoStation_Arguing_08": "This is becoming tiresome.",

    "ST_D_MonocoStation_FashionistQuest_Intro_04": "We Grandis are impervious to cold, and it is utterly dreadful for one such as me. Can you guess why?",
    "ST_D_MonocoStation_Disapproving_10": "We have faced many challenges since the Fracture, but our traditions live on, in one form or another.",
    "ST_D_MonocoStation_Worried_03": "We have the will, but have we the way?",
    "ST_D_MonocoStation_Disapproving_03": "We too once had grand arenas, like the Gestrals. But within our arenas, eloquence landed the killing blows.",
    "ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Maelle_09": "We trip and stumble on our knees.",
    "ST_D_MonocoStation_FashionistQuest_Intro_12": "What?",

    "03_CampMiLune_Lune": "Actually, I do.",
    "02_CampMiMaelle_Maelle": "After erasing your father? How do YOU feel?",
    "03_CampFbSciel_Sciel": "Ah, fantastic!",
    "08_CampMsSciel_Verso": "Ahhh, let me guess, you’ve been to one of their arenas?",
    "10_AftermathVersoMaelle_Verso": "Aline wants her son back. Renoir wants you and Aline back. You want Gustave back. The cycle we needed to break wasn’t the Gommage. It’s your family’s cycle of grief.",
    "01_CampOlSciel_Sciel": "All these years and you never defeated an Axon?",
    "07_CampMsMaelle_Verso": "Although… it only works on Nevrons with ears, so not every Nevron…",
    "07_CampScEsquie_Esquie": "Always, mon ami!",
    "06_CampMsLune_Lune": "Amazing. I wonder if we can achieve something similar…",
    "06_CampMsSciel_Verso": "An appropriate amount of trouble.",
    "11_AftermathLadies_Maelle": "And I didn’t see it at the time, but all the families who took turns taking care of me…",
    "10_CampEnSciel_Sciel": "And I understand… better than anyone. You know that.",
    "03_CampAct3BSciel_Verso": "And all the expeditioners I travelled with. It would be nice to tell them… we made it.",
    "11_CampA2Sciel_Sciel": "And either it will be enough, or it won’t.",
    "02_VersoSelfEsquie_Verso": "And get back Esquie’s final stone.",
    "06_CampFbSciel_Verso": "And just as fun. And sometimes just as deadly.",
    "03_CampMiSciel_Sciel": "And making it home in one piece.",
    "04_CampGvMaelle_Maelle": "And miss the chance to meet Esquie? No way!",
    "03_CampEnSciel_Sciel": "And somehow he knows I’m a “terrible swimmer.”",
    "11_AftermathVersoSciel_Sciel": "And that means, I can see my husband again.",
    "04_CampMsLune_Lune": "And the bell?",
    "03_CampA1Sciel_Verso": "And the next one is weaker.",
    "05_CampAct3BSciel_Verso": "And to explain. Things I never got a chance to explain.",
    "03_AftermathVersoLune_Verso": "And what would you have done in my position?",
    "03_CampOlSciel_Sciel": "And you think our chances are close to zero?",
    "06_CampA1Esquie_Verso": "Are you jealous? Why?",
    "04_CampScielEsquie_Esquie": "Are you troubled, mon amie?",
    "02_AftermathVersoEsquie_Verso": "Are you?",
    "02_CampAct3BEsquie_Verso": "Aren’t you scared of what we’ll find there?",
    "15_AftermathVersoSciel_Sciel": "As long as you help me bring Pierre back. You owe me.",
    "04_AftermathVersoEsquie_Esquie": "Bad things happen when we get mad.",
    "07_CampMsMonoco_Monoco": "Bah. It’s been ten years! Golgra needs to get over it.",
    "06_CampA2Esquie_Esquie": "Because we’re buddies! François is so fun.",
    "05_CampFbLune_Lune": "Because… he liked the idea of friendships that could last decades.",
    "03_CampMsSciel_Sciel": "Bet you guys got up to lots of trouble together.",
    "02_CampMaelleSciel_Sciel": "Better?",
    "06_AftermathVersoEsquie_Esquie": "But I can never be mad at you.",
    "05_CampMsNoco_Verso": "But I didn’t see a present? What was it?",
    "05_CampMiMaelle_Verso": "But relieved.",
    "12_CampMaelleLune_Lune": "But what I needed… was to use it. To use everything.",
    "01_CampMaelleSciel_Maelle": "Can you teach me to fight better?",
    "03_CampAct3AMonoco_Monoco": "Can’t rely on good hair and charm anymore. So what’s the plan?",
    "03_CampMiMaelle_Verso": "Conflicted.",
    "03_CampOlMaelle_Verso": "Course you are.",
    "03_CampAct3AEsquie_Esquie": "Cousins.",
    "01_CampMsNoco_Noco": "Did you get my present?",
    "02_CampA2Esquie_Esquie": "Did you know Soarrie was my FIRST rock?",
    "07_CampA2Sciel_Sciel": "Do I?",
    "05_CampAct3BLune_Verso": "Do you mean…",
    "13_Sisters_Verso": "Do you want the armband back?",
    "05_AftermathLadies_Lune": "Don’t apologise. You were trapped too. You lived among us. You’re one of us. Even if you’re also one of them.",
    "32_CampMaelleLune_Lune": "Don’t tell anyone else I said that.",
    "02_CampMsLune_Verso": "Don’t worry, he’s not interested in human feet.",
    "03_CampMsMonoco_Monoco": "Ehhhhh. Well, Golgra helped Noco start his merchant shop…",
    "04_CampMsEsquie_Verso": "Eh… I don’t think they’ll like that–",
    "10_CampMaelleSciel_Sciel": "Emotion can mess with your perceptions. Make you miss important details on the field.",
    "06_CampMaelleSciel_Sciel": "Emotions are powerful. You have to make sure they work with you, not against you.",
    "21_CampMaelleLune_Lune": "Especially when I use chroma. I feel their presence, their closeness. And they help me.",
    "01_CampEnLune_Lune": "Esquie must have experienced so much over the centuries.",
    "01_CampScielEsquie_Sciel": "Esquie?",
    "02_CampOlEsquie_Verso": "Esquie?",
    "02_CampEnSciel_Sciel": "Esquie? Yeah, he’s sweet.",
    "03_AftermathVersoEsquie_Esquie": "Esquies can be sad or bad or even rad! But never ever mad.",
    "17_CampMaelleSciel_Sciel": "Everyone has blind spots. So everyday, you ask yourself. What’s yours? What’s theirs? Do you know?",
    "09_AftermathVersoSciel_Sciel": "Everything I knew about our world is wrong. And you know what?",
    "01_CampScLune_Lune": "Expedition Zero left sixty seven years ago. Which would make you–",
    "05_CampA2Sciel_Sciel": "Extra long for you, I imagine.",
    "01_CampMsLune_Lune": "Feet? Really?",
    "03_CampAct3AMaelle_Verso": "Fine. As you wish.",
    "14_CampScielEsquie_Esquie": "First means number one. Second means number two.",
    "11_CampMaelleSciel_Sciel": "Fixate on the wrong thing. Or see what you want to see.",
    "06_CampMiEsquie_Esquie": "François and I were just trying to say hello! But she wouldn’t let us. Luckily you found us instead.",
    "22_CampScielEsquie_Sciel": "From so far away?",
    "05_CampMsLune_Verso": "Gift from the Grandis.",
    "03_CampSmLune2_Lune": "Good night, Gustave.",
    "16_CampEnSciel_Sciel": "Good night, Gustave.",
    "06_CampScEsquie_Verso": "Great, I'm counting on you.",
    "03_CampFbLune_Lune": "Gustave would have loved that.",
    "32_CampScielEsquie_Esquie": "Hehehe.",
    "03_Sisters_Verso": "Her name’s Alicia.",
    "02_CampScMaelle_Verso": "Hey.",
    "01_CampMaelleLune_Maelle": "Hey…",
    "02_CampMaelleLune_Lune": "Hey…",
    "03_AftermathVersoMaelle_Maelle": "He’s been weakened by his battle with Maman. That’s probably why he hasn’t come after us. But it won’t stop him for long.",
    "06_CampOlEsquie_Verso": "He’s not– [exhale] I know, buddy. I’m mad too.",
    "04_CampMaelleSciel_Sciel": "High praise.",
    "03_CampA2Sciel_Sciel": "Hm.",
    "15_CampMaelleSciel_Maelle": "Hm.",
    "02_CampScielEsquie_Esquie": "Hm?",
    "06_CampScielEsquie_Esquie": "Hm? I didn’t say that.",
    "06_CampOlSciel_Verso": "Hmm.",
    "12_CampA2Sciel_Verso": "Hmm.",
    "01_CampA1Esquie_Verso": "Hmm. I recognize that look. What’s got you so grumpy?",
    "01_CampFbMaelle_Maelle": "How come Monoco lives so far from the other gestrals?",
    "01_CampGobLune_Lune": "How did the Gestrals survive out here?",
    "28_CampMaelleLune_Maelle": "How do you always know what to do…",
    "01_CampMiMaelle_Verso": "How do you feel? After…",
    "01_CampFbSciel_Sciel": "How far up the mountain is Monoco’s Station? Will we see snow?",
    "03_CampScSciel_Verso": "How open-minded of you.",
    "14_CampMaelleSciel_Sciel": "How they move, how they think, how they react, so you can anticipate and adjust.",
    "06_CampMsNoco_Noco": "Hrmph! You’ll just have to wait and find out. But it’s SUPER cool.",
    "07_Sisters_Maelle": "Huh.",
    "31_CampMaelleLune_Maelle": "Huh. Really?",
    "20_CampMaelleLune_Lune": "I can almost feel them beside me. Everyone we’ve lost… walking with me.",
    "03_AftermathLadies_Lune": "I can’t believe there’s another world out there. A world I’ll never get to see.",
    "01_CampA2Lune_Lune": "I can’t believe we’re this close.",
    "03_CampGobLune_Lune": "I can’t wait to ask them. Gestrals!",
    "02_CampScEsquie_Verso": "I could say the same for you, you giant marshmallow. Bet you lost your stones again?",
    "17_Sisters_Verso": "I did. You’re not upset with me?",
    "04_CampOlSciel_Verso": "I didn’t think you cared about odds.",
    "08_CampMiEsquie_Esquie": "I do.",
    "09_AftermathVersoLune_Verso": "I don’t apologise for saving her. But I am sorry I broke your trust. And I will do everything I can to help bring everyone back.",
    "10_AftermathVersoSciel_Sciel": "I don’t care. ‘Cause death isn’t death anymore.",
    "01_CampSmMaelle_Maelle": "I don’t get it. How did I get all the way to the manor?",
    "02_CampSmMaelle_Gustave": "I don’t know. But I’m grateful to whoever saved you.",
    "09_Sisters_Verso": "I don’t know. That surprised me, when you told me.",
    "03_AftermathVersoSciel_Sciel": "I don’t need your mea culpa.",
    "01_CampAct3ASciel_Sciel": "I don’t usually get this nervous, but… Ohhhh, I’m nervous.",
    "29_CampMaelleLune_Lune": "I don’t.",
    "15_Sisters_Verso": "I feel like a fraud, wearing it. Given, you know…",
    "29_CampScielEsquie_Sciel": "I guess I do.",
    "02_CampAct3AEsquie_Verso": "I guess he’s not that different from my father.",
    "10_AftermathVersoLune_Lune": "I guess we’ll see…",
    "01_CampEnEsquie_Esquie": "I haven’t seen a human in so long! You’re much tinier than I remember.",
    "23_CampScielEsquie_Esquie": "I heard you, so I came.",
    "21_CampScielEsquie_Esquie": "I heard your tears.",
    "02_CampMiLune_Verso": "I honestly don’t know. But you probably don’t believe me.",
    "05_CampMaelleLune_Maelle": "I just…",
    "02_CampOlMonoco_Monoco": "I know.",
    "07_CampEnSciel_Sciel": "I know.",
    "07_CampMaelleSciel_Maelle": "I know.",
    "14_CampEnSciel_Sciel": "I like having you in my life.",
    "10_AftermathLadies_Maelle": "I love my family, but… they’re all gone. In one way or another. And you’re my family too. So are Gustave and Emma.",
    "01_CampA2Esquie_Esquie": "I miss Soarrie.",

    "07_CampScielEsquie_Sciel": "I remember it quite clearly.",
    "01_CampGvSciel_Sciel": "I still can’t believe it. I lost hope after a while, but you all survived.",
    "03_CampEnMaelle_Maelle": "I think you and Esquie are soul mates.",
    "01_CampEnSciel_Gustave": "I think you have a new best friend.",
    "06_AftermathVersoSciel_Verso": "I thought you’d be more upset.",
    "01_VersoSelfMonoco_Verso": "I told Monoco I’d help him bring Noco back.",
    "18_CampMaelleLune_Lune": "I use the pain, I use the fear, the shame, the guilt, the anger, I use it all to keep going. To make sure. I. Continue.",
    "02_AftermathVersoLune_Lune": "I was right not to trust you.",
    "07_AftermathVersoSciel_Sciel": "I was. I got over it.",
    "02_CampA2Maelle_Maelle": "I wish Gustave was here.",
    "04_AftermathVersoLune_Lune": "I wouldn’t have betrayed my expedition. I would have warned them that everyone they cared about was about to be erased. That THEY were about to be erased. I would have told them the truth. Because after everything we’ve been through, we deserved that.",
    "12_CampEnSciel_Sciel": "I'm just glad Lune found you… before it was too late.",
    "06_CampEnSciel_Gustave": "I, uh– After the beach… when I was alone, um– I almost…",
    "08_CampMsLune_Lune": "If we combine this with Pictos could we selectively use Nevron abilities in battle–",
    "04_AftermathVersoMaelle_Verso": "If you and your father keep fighting, you risk breaking the world again. Another Fracture, but this time, it might be you trapped inside the Monolith.",
    "10_CampScielEsquie_Esquie": "In the caves? Yeah.",
    "03_CampAct3BMonoco_Monoco": "Indeed. Life is more colourful with Noco by my side.",
    "01_CampMsMonoco_Monoco": "Is Golgra still mad at me?",
    "01_CampAct3BSciel_Sciel": "Is there anyone special you’d want Maelle to bring back? You’ve been around for 100 years. Anyone you miss?",
    "18_CampScielEsquie_Sciel": "It was you.",
    "04_CampA2Sciel_Verso": "It’s been a long road to get here.",
    "04_CampMaelleLune_Lune": "It’s fine.",
    "03_CampAct3ASciel_Sciel": "It’s not that I didn’t care before. I cared about the mission, but now…",
    "02_CampA2Sciel_Verso": "It’s nothing, just nerves.",
    "03_CampGvMaelle_Gustave": "It’s safer in the village.",
    "01_CampAct3ALune_Lune": "It’s strange, watching her.",
    "08_CampMaelleLune_Maelle": "It’s… it’s hard.",
    "06_AftermathLadies_Maelle": "It’s… so weird. I have memories of two childhoods. Two homes. Two Lumières.",
    "14_CampMaelleLune_Lune": "I– Mm.",
    "24_CampMaelleLune_Maelle": "I’d like to feel him with me too…",
    "06_AftermathMonoco_Verso": "I’ll do my best to earn their trust back.",
    "07_CampMsLune_Verso": "I’ll stick to my swords. I’m not too keen on turning into a Nevron.",
    "04_CampMiSciel_Verso": "I’m curious what you think.",
    "02_CampAct3AMaelle_Maelle": "I’m getting quite tired of people telling me to go home. So please, no more.",

    "02_AftermathVersoMaelle_Verso": "I’m surprised he hasn’t already.",
    "11_CampMaelleLune_Lune": "I’ve tried many ways of dealing with it. Running from it. Sitting with it. Compartmentalising it.",
    "26_CampScielEsquie_Sciel": "I… uh…",
    "13_CampEnSciel_Sciel": "Just like whoever found me.",
    "07_AftermathVersoLune_Verso": "Knowing what you know now, would you have helped me force my mother out of the Canvas?",
    "01_CampAct3BEsquie_Esquie": "Let’s explore under the ocean!",
    "03_CampAct3BMaelle_Maelle": "Let’s see if Esquie has more of that wine you like, maybe that’ll help.",
    "05_CampGvLune_Lune": "Losing an arm is quite a lemon.",
    "05_CampOlSciel_Sciel": "Lune and I have less than a year. But Maelle’s different.",

    "08_CampA1Esquie_Verso": "Maybe stop losing your rocks then. How do you lose them anyway? Don’t you swallow the rocks?",
    "04_CampAct3BMonoco_Verso": "Maybe we could stop by the Gestral Village for a little bit? We need more supplies anyway.",
    "01_CampGvMaelle_Gustave": "Maybe you should stay…",
    "03_CampA1Monoco_Monoco": "Maybe.",
    "06_AftermathVersoMaelle_Verso": "Maybe… Maybe you should go home.",
    "01_CampA2Esquie_Verso": "Me too.",

    "02_CampOlLune_Lune": "Mm.",

    "01_CampMsSciel_Sciel": "Monoco seems fun.",

    "01_AftermathMonoco_Monoco": "Not to say I told you so, but I do believe that I did in fact… tell you so.",

    "10_CampA1Esquie_Verso": "Okay yeah, uh… I see… It’s, uh… hard to control.",

    "04_HotelLove_LifeEnjoyer": "It made things more exciting at first but now it's awkward!",

    "01_FestivalVictor_Victor": "Mate, I wish I was going with ya! If we could just send a bigger force! Get ALL of Lumière to just throw EVERYTHING we got at the bloody Paintress. Ahhh, but my brother would kill me. His number’s up soon, and I’m guardian for his kid.",
    "10_FestivalMaxime_Gustave": "Maxime.",
    "02_FestivalMaxime_Gustave": "Maxime. You’re drunk.",
    "04_FestivalJerome_Jerome": "Maybe if they have Shield Domes. But they would’ve been overrun by Nevrons before they could build any.",
    "07_Quizmaster_Gustave": "Maybe later?",
    "07_Estelle_Sophie": "Maybe sculpt something more menacing… like a Nevron.",
    "11_TrashcanMan_TrashcanMan": "Maybe you can use it?",
    "15_Jules_Jules": "Maybe you'll win and I won't need it back. Or maybe I'll reclaim it off your dead bodies during my Expedition!",
    "19_Eloise_Sophie": "Me?",
    "12_FestivalEmma_Gustave": "Me? You’re her guardian too. You stop her.",
    "09_FestivalLucie_Gustave": "Meaning what? Make yourself accept the unacceptable? Make believe that happiness is… this?",
    "05_FestivalMichel_Michel": "Meh. We’re EXPEDITIONERS. Stay smart, yes, but be BOLD, eh? You can’t win if you don’t play.",

    "06_FestivalMichel_Gustave": "Money’s no good out there anyway. Why’re you trying to fleece me?",
    "10_FestivalLucie_Lucie": "More like… rediscover. Happiness. One Gommage left. Maybe contentment is the highest form of happiness.",
    "12_TrashcanMan_TrashcanMan": "Move on, the Paintress must not know I'm here.",
    "01_Ulysse_Ulysse": "My Gestral costume is the best!",

    "03_Henri_Henri": "Nah, the show's great, but etching chroma onto your skin? Oof, that's brutal. And just for a dance?",
    "11_FestivalAlan_Gustave": "No pressure.",
    "02_FestivalMichel_Gustave": "No way. Everyone knows you cheat.",
    "09_FestivalRaphael_Raphael": "No, it’s just– Things don’t always work out the way we want. No use getting upset, ya know? Use what we can. Leave what we can’t.",
    "10_FestivalSciel_Sciel": "No, not for that.",
    "02_Ophelie_Gustave": "No, the one you suggested earlier was perfect.",
    "12_FestivalLucie_Lucie": "No, you misunderstand. My mind is where I can be free. She can’t touch me there. This is my final act of defiance. Just like the Expedition is yours.",

    "14_MaelleDuel_Maelle": "No. I don’t.",
    "03_FestivalRaphael_Raphael": "No?",

    "21_Cyril_Cyril": "Nobody really cares about them anymore after their constant failures. But that would make a wonderful underdog story.",
    "03_FestivalMaxime_Maxime": "None of you ever come back. You go and you take our resources and you waste it all. On a fucked up hero adrenaline fantasy. And still. SHE kills us.",

    "01_HotelLove_Sophie": "Not everyone attends the Living Wake or goes to the Harbour for the Gommage.",
    "04_FestivalVictor_Gustave": "Not much hesitation on her part.",
    "04_Nicolas_Nicolas": "Not quite. I am only in love with her art.",
    "30_Quizmaster_Gustave": "Not really. I mean, I created the Lumina Converter… So…?",
    "07_Marie_Sophie": "Not today.",
    "03_TrashcanMan_Display": "Nothing special to see here, just a trash can.",

    "19_Cyril_Cyril": "Oh come on! I really need your help!",
    "02_Hairstylist_Amandine": "Oh hey handsome, perfect timing. I’m styling everyone before we ship out. Gotta look sharp when we hit the Paintress, eh?",
    "12_FestivalApprentices_Alexandre": "Oh hey, Gustave, your sister’s here!",
    "01_MaelleSophie_Maelle": "Oh hi Sophie.",
    "01_Tiffanie_Tiffanie": "Oh hi Sophie.",
    "16_Richard_Richard": "Oh, but you…",
    "12_FestivalAlan_Alan": "Oh, no. LOTS of pressure. You and Lune and your Lumina tech. That’s our edge.",
    "08_FestivalCatherine_Catherine": "Oh, that was over ages ago.",
    "18_Estelle_Sophie": "Oh, you don't have to.",
    "03_FestivalSeba_Seba": "Oh, you’re so boring. It’s our last night! Who knows when we’ll be back.",
    "09_FestivalCatherine_Gustave": "Oh. Sorry–",
    "02_MaelleSophie_Sophie": "Oh? Maelle? I didn't expect to see you here.",
    "01_Marie_Marie": "Oh… Sophie.",
    "16_Nicolas_Sophie": "Okay, I guess.",
    "22_Cyril_Cyril": "Okay, now I'm inspired.",
    "13_MaelleFirstDuel_Maelle": "Okay, you may have lost, but… don't you feel better? I see that smile.",
    "04_Hairstylist_Amandine": "On it. Just bring me a token first.",
    "04_TrashcanMan_Display": "Once again, a perfectly normal–",
    "07_Ulysse_Ulysse": "One day, I will meet one.",
    "08_ArtefactLady_Colette": "One token is all I ask. Come back when you have one.",
    "10_MaelleDuel_Maelle": "One year out there’s better than nine years in here.",
    "21_Eloise_Sophie": "Or maybe... Because I was afraid.",
    "08_FestivalLucien_Lucien": "Or was it “Always bring backup?” Eh. Same difference.",
    "06_TutorialOutcomes_Gustave": "Our beloved Chief Councilor. Yeah, I should go talk to her.",
    "10_TrashcanMan_TrashcanMan": "Ow! What's that? It's hurting my ass.",
    "08_Estelle_Estelle": "Paint it? Hmm…",
    "02_FestivalTristan_Gustave": "Perfect.",
    "06_Estelle_Sophie": "Perhaps you could paint it? Add some colour?",
    "02_MaelleDuel_Maelle": "Please. I’m more ready to go than you are.",
    "09_FestivalApprentices_Guillaume": "Promise!",
    "06_Ulysse_Ulysse": "Prove it. You can't, can you?",
    "01_FestivalMathilde_Mathilde": "Quite the party. Well, quality over quantity, eh? Story of our lives.",
    "01_FestivalBastien_Bastien": "Ready for tomorrow?",
    "05_Hairstylist_Amandine": "Ready for your new haircut?",
    "14_Quizmaster_Antoine": "Really, Gustave? I gave you such an easy question! Come on, try again.",
    "03_ArtefactLady_Colette": "Relics from before the Fracture, passed down through the generations. The Council deemed them trinkets, but I think otherwise.",
    "18_MaelleDuel_Gustave": "Right, ‘cause she needs eyes everywhere.",
    "09_FestivalLucien_Gustave": "Right.",
    "03_FestivalAlan_Alan": "Saw you with Sophie. You talked?",
    "17_Marie_Marie": "See you at the harbour.",
    "11_MaelleSophie_Sophie": "See you.",
    "17_Tiffanie_Tiffanie": "See you.",
    "23_Richard_Sophie": "See you.",

    "05_Cyril_Cyril": "See, I'm preparing the headline for tomorrow, and who could write it better than someone who celebrates her special day today!",
    "07_FestivalSciel_Gustave": "Seriously though, this is gonna hurt tomorrow.",
    "08_PictosTrader_Gustave": "Seriously? I can think of better ways to spend a token.",
    "14_FestivalEmma_Emma": "She really wants off this island.",
    "06_FestivalBastien_Bastien": "She won’t be there for long.",
    "06_Tiffanie_Sophie": "Shh, he might hear us.",
    "07_FestivalAlan_Gustave": "Shit.",
    "19_MaelleDuel_Maelle": "Shush. You’re lucky you have a sister who cares.",
    "02_Tiffanie_Tiffanie": "So Gustave really did come huh?",
    "12_Richard_Richard": "So I sewed a special uniform for him as my last gift.",
    "13_MaelleDuel_Gustave": "So do you–",
    "05_FestivalLune_Lune": "So much of the landscape has changed.",
    "07_Cyril_Sophie": "So, what will the article be about?",
    "09_FestivalSciel_Gustave": "Sober’s better than deathly hungover.",
    "02_HotelLove_Sophie": "Some prefer more… intimate goodbyes.",
    "01_RooftopsEnd_Maelle": "Sophie is down there.",
    "17_Estelle_Estelle": "Sophie, as a thank you, I shall chisel your name onto the statue.",
    "16_Estelle_Sophie": "Sophie.",
    "11_Tiffanie_Tiffanie": "Sophie…",
    "16_Marie_Marie": "Sorry…",
    "10_PictosTrader_Tom": "Still gonna cost you a token though. You’re a resourceful man, there are plenty of ways to earn tokens around here.",
    "13_Cyril_Sophie": "Sure, let me think of a headline…",
    "06_PictosTrader_Gustave": "Sure, why not…",
    "09_FestivalMaxime_Maxime": "THE PAINTRESS. What, what’s a scrawny shit like YOU gonna do to THE PAINTRESS. Eh? “We’re already dead. You’re just catching up.”",
    "06_MaelleSophie_Sophie": "Take care during the expedition. Gustave told me a lot of wonderful things about you.",
    "14_FestivalApprentices_Gustave": "Take care of each other.",
    "29_Cyril_Sophie": "Take care of yourself.",
    "11_ArtefactLady_Colette": "Take good care of it. Godspeed.",
    "27_Cyril_Cyril": "Thank you for all these times.",
    "02_Richard_Sophie": "Thank you, Richard.",
    "22_Nicolas_Sophie": "Thank you.",

    "07_Mime_Sophie": "Thanks, Gustave.",
    "06_Ophelie_Gustave": "Thanks, Ophélie.",
    "04_RooftopsEnd_Gustave": "Thanks.",
    "07_FestivalLune_Lune": "Thanks.",
    "14_Jules_Gustave": "Thanks.",
    "10_Nicolas_Nicolas": "That is of no consequence in the matters of love.",
    "28_Nicolas_Nicolas": "That was slightly disappointing.",
    "19_Nicolas_Nicolas": "That was splendid! Splendid!",
    "05_Ulysse_Ulysse": "That's what I think too. The others laugh, but I know they're real.",
    "13_Ulysse_Ulysse": "That's why I'm training everyday by beating up my little brother!",
    "03_Jules_Jules": "That's… He made that overnight?",
    "16_Eloise_Eloise": "That's… This guy is strong…",
    "14_Ulysse_Sophie": "That's… Yeah. You would make a great Gestral.",
    "03_FestivalMichel_Michel": "That’s just what sore losers say. Come now, you gonna be a little cautious mouse with the Paintress too?",
    "04_ArtefactLady_Gustave": "That’s kind of you to share.",
    "06_FestivalCatherine_Catherine": "That’s ok.",
    "05_Quizmaster_Antoine": "That’s tomorrow. What about today?",
    "08_FestivalMaxime_Gustave": "That’s why we’re going. We CAN save them. With our Lumina tech, the Paintress–",
    "06_Mime_Sophie": "That… That was close…",
    "01_FestivalEmma_Gustave": "The Chief Councilor honours us with her presence.",
    "03_Eloise_Eloise": "The Expeditions… What a joke.",
    "01_FestivalFlorian_Florian": "The Paintress is going to punish you! You blasphemers. The Gommage is our fault! We brought this upon ourselves. Because we dared to defy her!",
    "04_Mime_Display": "The mime reacts. It attacks!",
    "14_Cyril_Sophie": "The pale sun ascends above the crimson blossoms.",
    "08_MaelleDuel_Gustave": "The rest of us only have a year left, but you’ve got nine good years before your Gommage.",
    "06_FestivalMaxime_Gustave": "Then maybe you should be with her.",
    "18_Eloise_Eloise": "Then, madam, why didn't you join?",
    "04_FestivalLune_Lune": "Theoretically. I extrapolated from the archives, but… it was 67 years ago.",
    "07_FestivalEmma_Emma": "There are so many things you can contribute to HERE in Lumière. That’ll have a REAL impact.",
    "13_Eloise_Sophie": "There are some special people in this one.",
    "13_TrashcanMan_Display": "There is a message inside.",
    "09_Mime_Sophie": "There is something on its body.",
    "01_FestivalSciel_Gustave": "These all yours?",
    "17_Eloise_Sophie": "They all train their Pictos skills very hard to save us all. And so did your father.",
    "06_HotelLove_Display": "They stopped…",
    "03_FestivalApprentices_Alexandre": "They’ll definitely want that for the Museum! The complete record of the Expedition that DESTROYED the Paintress!",
    "01_FestivalJerome_Jerome": "Think there’s other survivors out there?",
    "03_FestivalEmma_Emma": "This is the definition of a fool’s quest, and my brother’s not usually a fool.",
    "02_Nicolas_Nicolas": "This lady truly is exquisite.",
    "04_Estelle_Estelle": "This may be my life's finest work, yet not a single soul seems to care.",
    "25_MaelleDuel_Maelle": "This time, I’m not messing around!",
    "15_Tiffanie_Sophie": "Tiffanie…",
    "06_FestivalSciel_Gustave": "To Soph.",
    "05_FestivalSciel_Sciel": "To Sophie. Who was always… unapologetically Sophie. My fierce and loving friend.",
    "17_Nicolas_Nicolas": "Too bad…",
    "03_TutorialOutcomes_Maelle": "Too slow, old man!",
    "02_Mime_Sophie": "Uh, hello?",
    "02_FestivalVictor_Gustave": "Uncle Victor. Suits you.",

    "09_Eloise_Eloise": "We could have spent one more year together instead of wasting it away…",
    "14_FestivalAlan_Gustave": "We have a really good team, thanks to you. That’s our edge.",
    "03_Mime_Sophie": "We should leave.",
    "05_FestivalJerome_Gustave": "We were lucky the Fracture dropped us out here. Bought us time to get our defences up.",
    "11_Ulysse_Ulysse": "We're tired of the orphanage…",
    "07_ArtefactLady_Colette": "Welcome back. You’re here for the artefact?",
    "29_Quizmaster_Antoine": "Well done, well done.",
    "13_Tiffanie_Tiffanie": "Well, there are less and less people to buy them…",
    "04_FestivalTristan_Gustave": "Well. It’s Lune.",
    "10_Cyril_Cyril": "Well…",
    "13_FestivalEmma_Emma": "We’re her guardians, not her jailers.",

    "30_Nicolas_Nicolas": "What a beautiful couple, thank you again.",
    "03_FestivalBastien_Gustave": "What about you? Heard you were elected “Commander 32.” Congrats.",
    "07_FestivalCatherine_Gustave": "What about you? You say goodbye to Derrick?",
    "16_Quizmaster_Gustave": "What are you talking about? Every child knows this. The Monolith’s essentially a reverse calendar, counting down since the Fracture happened in Year 100.",
    "05_FestivalSeba_Seba": "What can I say? I’m an optimist. Or an idiot. Depends on who you ask.",
    "24_Quizmaster_Antoine": "What is a “Lumina?”",
    "15_Estelle_Estelle": "What's your name?",
    "02_FestivalEmma_Gustave": "What. You still mad I’m going?",
    "02_MaelleFirstDuel_Gustave": "What?",
    "09_Jules_Gustave": "What?",
    "26_Eloise_Sophie": "When the time comes, you'll make the right decision. I'm sure.",
    "05_FestivalMaxime_Maxime": "Where do you THINK. Mourning her mother. On the ANNIVERSARY of her death. Of all their deaths.",
    "05_FestivalAlan_Gustave": "Where’s your daughter?",

    "06_Quizmaster_Gustave": "Who am I to deny you. Fire away.",
    "04_FestivalLucien_Gustave": "Who, exactly, are you talking to? They cut servers from the budget years ago.",
    "01_FestivalRaphael_Raphael": "Why does Manon keep saying “death comes to us all?”",
    "02_Henri_Sophie": "Why? Aren't you enjoying the show?",
    "14_Nicolas_Nicolas": "Will you help me? If you inspire me, you may become the main painting of Lumière's Opera.",
    "20_Cyril_Cyril": "With the Paintress each year claiming the beauty of this world.",

    "09_FestivalTristan_Tristan": "Yeaahh. Let’s just say, they ran a tight ship.",
    "04_MaelleFirstDuel_Gustave": "Yeah I hum… Yeah.",

    "14_Eloise_Eloise": "Yeah, right…",
    "04_FestivalCatherine_Gustave": "Yeah, umm.",
    "13_FestivalLucien_Gustave": "Yeah, well, we’ve only tested it here. Who knows what we’ll meet on the main continent. We’ll need more field-testing once we land.",
    "13_FestivalCatherine_Gustave": "Yeah, we’re all we have.",
    "05_FestivalLucie_Gustave": "Yeah.",

    "21_Richard_Sophie": "Yes, he is…",
    "06_Eloise_Eloise": "Yes, that's what my father told me last year.",
    "10_Quizmaster_Antoine": "Yes. When did our world break apart and our luminous city get thrown into the middle of the ocean? When was the Fracture?",
    "05_FestivalEmma_Emma": "You and I both know the political complexities that necessitate the Expedition. It’s vital for morale, but it’s a bloodless guillotine, is what it is–",
    "32_Quizmaster_Gustave": "You big softie.",
    "01_FestivalLucie_Gustave": "You came.",
    "08_FestivalRaphael_Gustave": "You can really find the silver lining in everything, can’t you?",
    "04_FestivalSciel_Sciel": "You can start now. Here, let’s have a toast.",
    "28_Quizmaster_Antoine": "You created the Lumina Converter. How can you not know this? Go again.",

    "03_MaelleFirstDuel_Maelle": "You look tense.",
    "16_FestivalEmma_Emma": "You mean the one you so kindly wrote for me?",
    "10_FestivalLune_Gustave": "You need a drink.",
    "12_Eloise_Sophie": "You never know, this Expedition might be different.",

    "04_FestivalMaxime_Gustave": "You should go home. Where’s your daughter?",
    "06_FestivalEmma_Gustave": "You should put that in your speech. Very motivating. They might just find a guillotine for you too.",
    "08_Jules_Jules": "You take it.",
    "02_Quizmaster_Gustave": "You want a rematch don’t you?",
    "12_MaelleFirstDuel_Maelle": "You won! Now, don't you feel better? I see your smile.",

    "36_RdMa3Lumiere_Verso": "Not just the place, but… everything about that time. The festivals, the gardens, dancing the night away on the harbour… Before– all this.",

    "09_RdMa6ALetter_Maelle": "She’s the one who kept coming to me. I think she wants to see me.",
    "14_RdMa3Lumiere_Verso": "So was I.",

    "19_RdMa2Poems_Maelle": "That doesn’t surprise me.",
    "10_RdMa3Lumiere_Verso": "That must have sucked. For both you and them.",
    "27_RdMa4Dreams_Maelle": "That’s lovely.",

    "48C_RdMa7Betrayal_Display": "The trust Maelle had in Verso is broken.",
    "46_RdMa3Lumiere_Display": "Then head back to the others.",

    "13_RdMa3Lumiere_Maelle": "Then they died. And I bounced around from family to family. I can’t even remember all of them. I was… kind of a weird kid, I guess.",
    "34_RdMa7Betrayal_Verso": "There were too many of them to save.",
    "43_RdMa2Poems_Display": "They go back to the others after Maelle is done teasing Verso.",
    "36_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Display": "They head back to the others.",
    "69_RdMa7Betrayal_Display": "They head to the Monolith, and Maelle repaints it.",
    "08_RdMa3Lumiere_Maelle": "They never wanted kids. And they definitely didn’t want one right before their Gommage.",
    "71_RdMa7Betrayal_Display": "They return to camp, to the rest of the Expedition.",

    "26_RdMa7Betrayal_Maelle": "Wait, so you’ve been watching me this whole time?",
    "29_RdMa3Lumiere_Maelle": "Wandering around the buildings.",
    "20_RdMa3Lumiere_Maelle": "Well, I was a weird kid in everyone’s eyes.",

    "32_RdMa2Poems_Verso": "Well, so is mine.",
    "13_RdMa7Betrayal_Maelle": "Well, we all did.",
    "19_RdMa4Dreams_Maelle": "Well, what did you used to want?",

    "27_RdMa3Lumiere_Verso": "What did you do in Lumière?",
    "18_RdMa4Dreams_Verso": "What do I want… I guess I’m still figuring that out too.",
    "16_RdMa5Grief_Maelle": "What does that mean?",
    "42_RdMa7Betrayal_Verso": "What is it?",
    "10_RdMa4Dreams_Verso": "What kind of life they dreamed for you.",
    "01_RdMa3Lumiere_Verso": "What was it like for you, growing up in Lumière?",
    "08_RdMa6ALetter_Verso": "What, kept her scars? No. Don’t go messing with her head, she doesn’t need that, and she doesn’t owe you any answers.",
    "02_RdMa6ALetter_Verso": "What?",
    "37_RdMa7Betrayal_Verso": "What?",
    "26_RdMa3Lumiere_Verso": "What’s something you liked about Lumière?",
    "03_RdMa5Grief_Verso": "What’s wrong?",
    "24_RdMa4Dreams_Verso": "When the lights dim and the room is hushed and the first notes echo through the chamber.",
    "29_RdMa2Poems_Verso": "Whoah, kind of a personal request there.",
    "07_RdMa6ALetter_Maelle": "Why Maman…",
    "24_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Verso": "Why did she do that?",
    "23_RdMa2Poems_Maelle": "Why, what do you write about? You don’t seem like a sunshine and rainbows type.",

    "12_RdMa4Dreams_Verso": "Why? What did you dream of?",
    "20_RdMa6ALetter_Verso": "With the third Axon.",

    "32_RdMa3Lumiere_Verso": "Yah? What was your favourite place?",
    "39_RdMa2Poems_Maelle": "Yeah, I can’t promise that.",
    "35_RdMa3Lumiere_Verso": "Yeah, I do.",
    "18_RdMa2Poems_Verso": "Yeah, I enjoy depressing poetry too.",
    "02_RdMa4Dreams_Maelle": "Yeah, I guess. Why?",
    "16_RdMa3Lumiere_Verso": "Yeah, I was obsessed with my piano and my paint set.",
    "33_RdMa2Poems_Maelle": "Yeah, but I bet you secretly want people to read it.",
    "12_RdMa3Lumiere_Maelle": "Yeah, it did.",
    "62_RdMa7Betrayal_Maelle": "Yeah, it looks bland without a number.",
    "14_RdMa6ALetter_Verso": "Yeah, of course. She doesn’t want to see me though. Not after everything.",
    "19_RdMa5Grief_Maelle": "Yeah, that’s true, but… that’s not very comforting when I’m missing him.",
    "07_RdMa7Betrayal_Verso": "Yeah.",
    "39_RdMa3Lumiere_Verso": "Yeah. And you’ve got me.",
    "22_RdMa4Dreams_Verso": "Yeah. Before the Fracture, I studied piano at the Conservatory.",
    "04_RdMa7Betrayal_Maelle": "Yeah. I kind of miss seeing her there.",

    "15_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Verso": "You Painters. You just do what you want, you don’t care how it affects the rest of us.",

    "27_RdMo5Thoughts_Verso": "Well it’s up to us to make sure they go away.",
    "02_RdMo1Bragathon_Verso": "Well, I didn’t spend the last few years hiding in the mountains.",

    "33_RdSc3Scars_Verso": "I know, that’s the real reason I keep them.",
    "07_RdSc2Bracelets_Verso": "I need a topic, I can’t just spit out stories on command.",
    "23_RdSc3Scars_Verso": "I never thought of it that way… but you’re right.",
    "08_RdSc6BClass_Verso": "I tied myself to Monoco for a month and we spent every minute of the day together.",
    "25_RdSc7Suicide_Sciel": "I tried to drown myself.",
    "28_RdSc7Suicide_Sciel": "I tried to swim away from Lumière. I swam for as long as I could, as far as the waves would carry me.",

    "43_RdSc5Pierre_Sciel": "I understand. Good night.",
    "06_RdSc5Pierre_Verso": "I used to love the gardens of Lumière. It must look quite different now.",

    "12_RdSc6BClass_Verso": "I was also the swim captain at school…",
    "25_RdSc5Pierre_Sciel": "I was prepared for his Gommage. But not for him to die in an accident.",
    "19_RdSc7Suicide_Sciel": "I would have done anything to see him again. To hear his voice. To feel his arms around me.",
    "23_RdSc1Stories_Sciel": "If we’re going to share, let’s share.",
    "16_RdSc7Suicide_Sciel": "If you asked me now, then no. I’ve seen how this torments you. I wouldn’t wish that on others.",
    "22_RdSc3Scars_Sciel": "If you can control your healing, that means Renoir can too. And he made the same choice as you. Interesting.",
    "03_RdSc5Pierre_Verso": "Is a double-headed scythe very useful on a farm though?",
    "15_RdSc4Philosophy_Verso": "Is it. Or are you just dressing it up to manage your fear?",
    "02_RdSc4Philosophy_Sciel": "Is that a question?",
    "13_RdSc6BClass_Sciel": "Is that supposed to be impressive? That you swam with other kids 100 years ago?",
    "02_RdSc1Stories_Sciel": "Is that your conclusion? After your… extensive observation of our team?",
    "37_RdSc5Pierre_Verso": "Is there a future where I might… compete… in the same event?",
    "51_RdSc6BClass_Display": "It is truly passionate.",
    "46_RdSc7Suicide_Sciel": "It is.",
    "18_RdSc6ASwimming_Verso": "It is. Go get changed and meet me at the lake.",
    "21_RdSc3Scars_Verso": "It was the first time we ever raised a hand against the other.",
    "25_RdSc3Scars_Sciel": "It was worthy.",
    "32_RdSc6BClass_Sciel": "It was… something.",
    "43_RdSc7Suicide_Verso": "It would solve a lot of problems. For everyone.",
    "45_RdSc7Suicide_Verso": "It’s a choice, like any other choice.",
    "11_RdSc3Scars_Verso": "It’s a reminder of the price I paid to stand on my own two feet. But it meant walking away from people I cared about.",
    "17_RdSc6BClass_Verso": "It’s about control.",
    "16_RdSc6BClass_Verso": "It’s about fear.",
    "14_RdSc2Bracelets_Verso": "It’s about my hair.",
    "05_RdSc7Suicide_Sciel": "It’s good that you can admit I’m smarter.",
    "02_RdSc6BClass_Sciel": "It’s just I have… an aversion to swimming.",
    "17_RdSc5Pierre_Sciel": "It’s just… it still hurts that he’s gone.",
    "29_RdSc5Pierre_Sciel": "It’s ok. I’ve learned to be grateful for the time we did have, instead of angry at the time we lost.",
    "16_RdSc5Pierre_Sciel": "It’s ok…",
    "14_RdSc3Scars_Sciel": "It’s probably not a coincidence then, that Renoir has a similar scar?",
    "43_RdSc4Philosophy_Verso": "I’ll admit, it’s been awhile.",
    "02_RdSc3Scars_Verso": "I’ll be honest, I didn’t expect things to get so deep so fast.",
    "05_RdSc5Pierre_Verso": "I’ll bet.",
    "09_RdSc1Stories_Verso": "I’ll trade you. A story for a story. Quite fair, I think.",
    "14_RdSc6ASwimming_Verso": "I’m a team player. But nobody enjoys sitting in wet clothes.",

    "01_RdSc6ASwimming_Verso": "I’m going for a swim with Esquie, care to join?",
    "03_RdSc7Suicide_Verso": "I’m not as smart as you, you’ll have to connect the dots for me.",
    "12_RdSc1Stories_Sciel": "I’m pretty sure you actually enjoy being mysterious. But alright, give us a story then.",
    "39_RdSc7Suicide_Verso": "I’m so sorry.",
    "24_RdSc5Pierre_Verso": "I’m sorry.",
    "46_RdSc6BClass_Sciel": "I’m sorry.",
    "14_RdSc6BClass_Verso": "I’m still a good swimmer now, it’s not something you forget.",
    "39_RdSc4Philosophy_Sciel": "I’m waiting for you to connect the dots.",
    "41_RdSc7Suicide_Verso": "I’ve… had similar thoughts before.",
    "22_RdSc6BClass_Verso": "Just sit here in the water for a little bit.",
    "43_RdSc6BClass_Verso": "Let’s celebrate.",
    "38_RdSc5Pierre_Sciel": "Let’s just focus on today.",
    "21_RdSc2Bracelets_Verso": "Luckily the Gestral Village has a hairstylist quite skilled in colour treatments.",
    "22_RdSc2Bracelets_Sciel": "Lucky.",
    "04_RdSc4Philosophy_Verso": "Lune’s intense and obsessed, Maelle is nervous and eager. But you, you’re calm.",
    "38_RdSc6BClass_Sciel": "Maelle can bring Pierre back. I’m sorry.",
    "16_RdSc3Scars_Verso": "Maelle’s right, you really do see everything.",
    "10_RdSc7Suicide_Verso": "Mmm. Makes sense.",
    "25_RdSc4Philosophy_Sciel": "Mmmm, yes. You must have many pearls to offer.",
    "34_RdSc2Bracelets_Sciel": "My youngest student is six. Her parents will gommage when she’s 12, and she herself won’t live past 21.",
    "19_RdSc5Pierre_Sciel": "Neither of us were perfect, but we were perfect for each other.",
    "43_RdSc2Bracelets_Sciel": "No, I don’t. But I have my students.",
    "21_RdSc1Stories_Sciel": "No, tell me something dark and melancholy. And personal.",
    "07_RdSc3Scars_Sciel": "No, you said you’re vain.",
    "10_RdSc1Stories_Verso": "No, you’re right, what was I thinking? It’s better to stay mysterious.",
    "42_RdSc4Philosophy_Verso": "Not counting Monoco?",
    "32_RdSc2Bracelets_Verso": "Not necessarily…",
    "42_RdSc7Suicide_Verso": "Not of drowning specifically, but… you know.",
    "29_RdSc6BClass_Verso": "Now, let’s see you swim back.",
    "03_RdSc6BClass_Verso": "Oh, I can help you with that.",
    "04_RdSc3Scars_Verso": "Oh, I can keep up. In fact, I’m here to offer a story.",
    "26_RdSc4Philosophy_Sciel": "Oh, actually isn’t Monoco even older? Esquie too. Perhaps I should ask them instead.",
    "06_RdSc6BClass_Sciel": "Oh, do share your secrets then.",
    "08_RdSc1Stories_Sciel": "Oh, is that what this is?",
    "34_RdSc6BClass_Sciel": "Oh.",
    "13_RdSc2Bracelets_Sciel": "Oh. I’m so intrigued.",
    "39_RdSc6BClass_Verso": "Oh. No, right, of course. I understand, don’t worry.",
    "10_RdSc3Scars_Sciel": "Oh. Why is that?",
    "40_RdSc4Philosophy_Verso": "Ohhh. You mean… adventure.",
    "12_RdSc2Bracelets_Verso": "Okay, I’m going to share something deeply personal with you.",
    "11_RdSc2Bracelets_Verso": "Okay, I’m going to share something really dark with you.",

    "07_RdSc7Suicide_Sciel": "Pierre… used to volunteer at the school, teaching the kids how to sail and survive in the wild.",
    "28_RdSc4Philosophy_Verso": "Please do. You’ll probably learn valuable things about Nevron feet and rocks.",
    "17_RdSc2Bracelets_Sciel": "Please. Do share.",
    "41_RdSc2Bracelets_Sciel": "Precisely.",
    "07_RdSc5Pierre_Sciel": "Probably a lot more variety than back then. The Outdome teams brought back loads of new plants from the surrounding islands.",
    "24_RdSc2Bracelets_Sciel": "Purple could be fun.",
    "27_RdSc4Philosophy_Verso": "Sadly, no pearls.",

    "54_RdSc4Philosophy_Display": "She’s not used to being rejected, but she doesn’t take it personally.",
    "10_RdSc5Pierre_Verso": "Smart man. If you want to romance a farmer, live plants are probably better than dead flowers.",
    "23_RdSc6ASwimming_Display": "Sneaky Verso.",
    "04_RdSc7Suicide_Verso": "So obvious.",
    "12_RdSc3Scars_Verso": "So there you have it. “Dark and personal.”",

    "35_RdSc4Philosophy_Sciel": "That depends. How adventurous are you feeling?",
    "41_RdSc5Pierre_Verso": "That might not be a good idea. I don’t know if I can keep my feelings casual.",
    "26_RdSc2Bracelets_Sciel": "That was hardly dark or personal.",
    "11_RdSc6ASwimming_Verso": "That way you can save me if I fall into the water.",
    "10_RdSc6ASwimming_Verso": "That way, if you fall into the water, I don’t have to ruin my clothes jumping in after you.",
    "30_RdSc5Pierre_Verso": "That’s a good way to look at it.",
    "35_RdSc5Pierre_Verso": "That’s a nice way to say “fling.”",

    "45_RdSc5Pierre_Display": "Though she doesn’t show it, Verso knows that she appreciates the support.",
    "20_RdSc4Philosophy_Sciel": "True, I’m not quite as old as you. Why don’t you share some of the wisdom you’ve accumulated over your very long life.",
    "08_RdSc6ASwimming_Sciel": "Tsk. Esquie.",
    "56_RdSc7Suicide_Display": "Two close friends, able to enjoy the silence together.",

I can’t wait to rejoin the mountaineering team.\n\nI still remember that first mountain we scaled. Watching the sun rise above the clouds was magical. But rappelling down as we set the handholds was pure exhilaration. \n\nI know some of the others chafe at being restricted to recon-only. I get it’s not very satisfying making maps and prepping trails while people are dying, but this prep work will pay off in the long run. It may not be glamorous, but truly essential work rarely is. Doesn’t make it any less important.

But as Olivier would say, it is also our “grandest.” I wish you were here, making that joke for the thousandth time.\n\nI’m proud of our work, we’ve pieced together so much. I just wish we had more time. The Gommage is still a few months away. Perhaps I can make one last trek.\n\nIf you’re reading this, my unknown future friend, I hope the information we’ve gathered helps you find answers.

The final set of grapple points were excruciatingly complex to place and required painstaking focus and skill.\n\nBut we were bold, we were ambitious, and we refused to stop. There’s no other group of people I’d rather be with, and it is an honour to die by their side.\n\nIt is fitting that we greet our end together, within the Monolith that has loomed over us for so long.

Nothing ever changes. They just send us out to die. Dissenters. And the status quo continues. At least out here, I don’t have to pretend anymore.\n\nI don’t bear the others any ill will.

I suspect there is a deeper level of chroma beyond what pictos enable us to manipulate. \n\nThe pull of chroma grows as we get closer to the Monolith.

It might not be stable, but the bang’s gonna be worth it.

I suppose, at its core, it’s a record that we existed. That we still exist.\n\nThe Gommage is coming, but I feel at peace. It’s just the two of us, but we’ve managed to carve out a tiny sliver of a life of our own. \n\nI should feel guilty, maybe, for abandoning the mission.

It is bittersweet, but at least the most important parts of their civilization will survive, their children.

After surviving that, crushing those Nevrons was almost an afterthought. \n\nStrength and resilience, it’s how we survived that storm and it’s how we grabbed VICTORY!

She’d have yelled at us for even staying this long. \n\nIt’s the right choice. It is. Even if it doesn’t feel like it. Right? Right. \n\nPons found a plant, tested it on some animals, says it’ll be painless for Dom. He’s preparing a tincture. It’s fucked up, everything’s fucked up, but it’s what she would’ve wanted.",

It has a small city on its back that I really want to explore, but the others think it’s too risky, too easy to get caught by the Nevs around here. Bah!\n\nVerso called this thing an Axon, apparently they are incredibly powerful, with hearts of pure chroma. Utterly unkillable! Except clearly something did.\n\nVerso and his father, Renoir, spent years trying to kill the Axons, hoping to forge their hearts into a weapon to break the Barrier. But no dice. \n\nI bet the Curator would love to get his hands on one of those hearts, he could easily forge such a weapon.",

But the sonics have NO effect on the Nevrons here. It’s as if they can’t even hear our music, they just keep dancing to their own. \n\nWe’re running out of ideas. I miss my girls so much it kills me. It hurts thinking that I could have been home right now, playing music while they dance. Rochelle would’ve given birth by now. I could be holding my first grandchild. Instead I’m here.\n\nNo, no. There’s still a chance. And someone has to fight for them. I can’t let them down. \n\nDrums. Maybe that will work. They can’t hear our music, but perhaps they will feel it.",

Just like we are.\n\nI swear to you, I’m doing what’s right.\n\nI should have known when you started questioning things, that you wouldn’t be fooled. But how could I even explain.

Absolute BLOODY bullshit.\n\nHe and his father keep saying the Paintress is the solution, not the problem, but I don’t buy it anymore. I think they’re lying about what happened to Expedition Zero. Somehow everyone else died but they walked out without a scratch?\n\nIt hurts to think he’d betray us, but nobody ever expects to be betrayed. His mistake though, is thinking his charm is sufficient to sell his lies. We’ll take him tomorrow night. Claude, Louise, and Dion are no fools, they saw what I saw. We WILL get answers. And if he is a traitor, then he will share the fate of traitors.",
    "01_Exp59_Exp59Julien": "Julien, 59er\n\n…disgusting. Laure’s an idiot, I can’t believe she convinced everyone to eat the Nevron. They’ve been puking for the past few hours. Great. \n\nWell, we can’t move on with so many people sick. I TOLD her it was a bad idea. Hopefully they’ll feel better with some mushroom broth to settle their stomachs…",
    "01_Exp37_Exp37Laure": "Laure, 37th expedition\n\nShould I feel guilty for enjoying what’s left of my life? Should I feel guilty for abandoning the others when the expedition was so clearly doomed?\n\nNobody listened to me, apparently getting slaughtered by Nevrons or this white haired man is an appealing future for them all. \n\nAt least I had fun here. I didn’t realise how quickly time has passed. The gommage is tomorrow. \n\nI’ve been trying to overcome this gestral’s challenge for months now but it seems even more of a challenge than defeating the Paintress. I guess I’ll never see the Gestral’s grand prize. \n\nThat’s my only regret in life.",
    "01_Exp56_Exp56Lisette": "Lisette, 56th\n\nIn my youth I mistook drama for passion. Simone helped me understand the difference. Opened my eyes to an entirely different way to experience the world. \n\nHow can she be gone? How? How could they so callously, so nonchalantly, destroy such a beautiful soul? Vile, vile, VILE. They just killed her. Like she was a worthless Nevron. Those cold-blooded, treacherous, despicable parasites.\n\nBut my trap worked. We caught one of those white-haired bastards. She looks human, but I know she’s a monster. She refuses to speak, but I’ll make her talk. And then I will FEED her to a Nevron. Then the Paintress can take me, I don’t care, nothing matters. \n\nI WILL HAVE JUSTICE.",
    "01_Exp67_Exp67Luc": "Luc - Expedition 67\n\nWe’re out of explosives, but we’ve made enough holes in this place to reach that giant woman in the centre.\n\nBut something weird’s going on. Everyone’s been swept up in strange emotions, it both feels like us but also not like us?\n\nMarguerite reckons we’re feeling the overflow from that giant woman’s feelings. “Empathic distress,” I think she called it. Like her mind is flooding the area with her thoughts and feelings?\n\nMaybe. Maybe we’ll just stay here and… enjoy the melody.",
    "01_Exp50_Exp50Lucile": "Lucile of the 50th\n\nOur beautiful Wheel, wedged upon the rocks, a casualty of the massive Serpent of the sea. But even shattered, its presence is still comforting.\n\nAdrien and Gabriel are doing their best to sustain morale, but with no food, no clean water, no way to fix the Wheel, our fate is quite clear. To me, at least. But I have no desire to hold back the hopes of others. Perhaps. Perhaps we will find a way back.\n\nStill. These moments of quiet, sitting on the beach, are also a source of contentment. All our lives we’ve been running, trying to outrace time. Trying to reach an unreachable goal. And now we can finally rest.\n\nAt least we got to see some of the wonders of this world. Even the Serpent, cruel as it is, has a deadly elegance that is mesmerising. But oh, what other marvels might we have seen had we been able to keep rolling?\n\nI sometimes wonder what it would have been like to grow up outside the Dome. Perhaps even live amongst the Nevrons. Could we have achieved a form of peace? Or even prospered alongside them?",
    "01_Exp35_Exp35Mathieu": "Mathieu, 3-5\n\nThey were so… Brave… So that’s what it means to lay the trail… I survived and will continue on, but to all the heroes of my team I dedicate our journal. All of them were bleeding out from our battle with the terrifying Nevron roaming this area. Yet in their final moments, they used their bodies to create a bridge for those who come after. Expedition 35 is over but tomorrow comes.",
    "01_OldLumiere_Melanie": "Melanie, 5 February\n\nThe Brigadiers are overdue from their mission to the Monolith and we’ve lost half our remaining fighting strength to these creatures and their relentless assault. \n\nAll adults have taken up arms, but I’m a bookkeeper, what am I supposed to do? Count them before they slaughter us? \n\nWe’ve hidden the children. At least they’re warm and dry in the cellars, but rations are running low. Things are calmer now at the hospital, but that’s because most die before we can get to them.\n\nI guess I’m living out of pure stubbornness at this point. Survival isn’t really survival anymore.\n\nEveryone’s so quiet lately, afraid we’ll draw attention. Sometimes I talk to myself just to hear another human voice. \n\nTrevor, you promised I could die before you. You promised.",
    "01_Exp44_Exp44Nicolas": "Nicolas, Exp44\n\nThe idea was we’d only have to fool the first one. Then Jules can wear its carcass to trap the next, and so on, until we all have proper cover. \n\nBut disguising ourselves as Nevrons has proven to be extremely ineffective, to say the least. Maybe they recognize each other by their chroma? \n\nAnyway, it was an utter failure. To any Expeditions that follow our trail: do NOT disguise yourselves as Nevrons. It… doesn’t work.",
    "01_Exp100A_Simon": "Simon\n\nMore and more of my mind is fading away. I must put my words down on paper before I lose myself entirely. \n\nMy beautiful Clea… \n\nWhat did she do to you? That Paintress… She fooled me, she looked so much like you and I believed her story. She granted me the power to fell the Axons and enter the Monolith. \n\nI realised too late that she had warped my mind, that she had in fact taken you away, locked you somewhere I could never reach, and set me on a path to destroy your future.\n\nBut then I met Aline, who showed me that I could save you. With her help, I descended to the bottom of the Monolith, where Aline had sealed Him away. The one who brings the Gommage. The one who threatens our very existence. But his powers are strong and I am finding it harder and harder to fight his influence over my mind. \n\nMy mind is breaking. My final thoughts are only of you. And I despair. But one day our suffering will end and we will find our way back to each other. In this life or another.",
    "01_Exp78_Exp78Maxance": "The 78 - Maxance\n\n…stealing the airships, but we knew we had to try. And it WORKED. \n\nWe deserve strong leaders, not those old fools on the Council, hiding under the Dome. Under their control, our people are condemned to a slow inevitable extinction. \n\nTheir timid half-steps achieve NOTHING. The answers are NOT in Lumière. They are out HERE. \n\nOur only choice is to take matters into our own hands. Fortune favours the bold. We must forge ahead with CONVICTION.",
    "01_Exp51_Exp51Thibault": "Thibault, Expedition 51\n\n…shortly after dawn. Death was a kindness, for Maxim was in a great deal of pain. Pain we could not help him carry. \n\nTomorrow comes,\nAnd it comes for us all.\nMay it bring you the gift of peace,\nAnd not just the gift of sorrow. \n\nNo one else will ever understand. Not the way my fellow expeditioners understand. Maxim. Clément. Fabien. Guillaume. Carla. \n\nWe’re bound by something deeper than blood or love. There is a shared unity, a shared trust, born from all we’ve been through. \n\nWe carry each other’s lives in our hands. There is no greater intimacy. I’m no longer lost. I know exactly who I am now. And exactly what I am capable of. \n\nLife is not easy. Life was never easy. But we have each other. And that makes all the difference.",
    "01_Exp47_Exp47Thomas": "Thomas of the 47th Drunken Brigade\n\nBenjamin’s been calling us the “Drunken Brigade!” Ha! I love it. Yeah, we do our best work after a few. \n\nThe trick is finding that PERFECT point where your nerves have calmed enough that your mind and body are one, but not so calm that your reactions are dulled. Some of the lads haven’t QUITE managed riding that edge, but I remain in full control of my body and thoughts! \n\nOh, sounds like someone spotted another Nevron. Better fuel up for our next dance. FOR LUMIÈRE!",
    "01_Exp52_Exp52Theo": "Théo, 52nd Expedition\n\nMerde, I can barely think straight. That hulking gestral broke my skull. What the fuck kind of “friendly fight” was that?? \n\nI’m bleeding out but their medic is bloody useless, he just keeps telling me about his bone problems. Putain, I’m gonna die here, aren’t I?",
    "01_Exp48_Exp48Vincent": "Vincent, 48th\n\nHe wouldn’t listen, just kept running everyone into the ground. He acted as if he was the only true believer, that we had to trust him. Five dead and he wanted to double down.\n\nThomas not so subtly insinuated that Jean should be relieved of duty. Mutiny. Something I’d never have countenanced, yet I have a duty to them too.\n\nIt’s a gutting realisation, what has to be done. The mission is too important. The team is too important. We can’t just throw our lives away for nothing. I hate that it came to this, but he broke our trust. \n\nUnder Expedition Code 23, Jean Fournier is hereby relieved of duty. I, Vincent Constantin, have assumed command and have designated Thomas Fliegauff as Lieutenant.",
    "01_Exp62_Exp62Virgile": "Virgile, Expedition 62\n\nEugène beat the rest of us to 100 kills, but I’m still three shy. I might need to do some solo hunting if I’m going to even up the score. \n\nOh, I hear a big Nev coming, they count for double. If I kill it quick I can boost my score.",
    "01_Exp60_Exp60William": "William, Expedition 60\n\nThey mocked us when we said the human body is the strongest of them all. We trained relentlessly and now our bodies have achieved the pinnacle of human performance, with which we are able to crush our enemies! \n\nWe are SO much more agile and aerodynamic without the heavy uniforms constraining our glorious muscles. With Leslie’s unstoppable training regime, WE ARE IMPERVIOUS. \n\nThat’s how we were able to charge through that ghostly gommage barrier and reach the Paintress. But it seems we’ve been wrong about what she is. The Paintress is just as trapped as we. The real terror lies beneath the Monolith.\n\nThe rest of Expedition 60 marched on to confront him, while I was tasked to warn Lumière. But it seems I might have run out of time. One last swim separates me from Lumière, but even with my mighty muscles, I don’t know if I can outswim the Gommage.\n\nSo here I write my final message. Bare naked muscles will save the world! And don’t waste time on the Paintress, aim for the bottom of the Monolith!",
    "01_Exp84_Exp84Yasmine": "Yasmine, Monolith Year 84\n\nMy favourite theory is that she’s some crazy demonic maths teacher, and this is our punishment for failing at numbers! \n\nA load of superstitious hysteria, but at least we’re here now. It’s worth it just to walk these valleys. I’ve barely seen a meadow since Lady Genocide and her poison smoke took up residence. \n\nAnd the sky. I feel almost naked without the Dome above us. We’re so exposed, but it’s thrilling too. \n\nWe landed at the exact spot where Expedition Zero touched ground and retraced their route, but there’s not a SINGLE scrap of cloth or body anywhere. \n\nBloody hell, we’re out here chasing shadows, 15-year old shadows. I’m glad we restarted the Expeditions, but how the hell are we supposed to find them, no trail could last 15 years…",
    "01_RenoirSirene_RealRenoir": "You speak to me of perfection, but is there really any such thing? Or is it a siren, leading us astray. I happily predict that neither of us will ever summit that elusive peak, but I care little, as long as we walk together. Art gives us the perception of control. For a moment, as I paint, I find order among the chaos. That is, for me, a moment of pure contentment. And that is truly better than perfection.",
    "01_RenoirVisages_RealRenoir": "…art can be a Window and art can be a Mirror. And great art. Great art is both. Son, you’ll never be a true artist if there’s always a mask between you and the viewer, especially when the viewer is you…",
    "01_RenoirManor_RealRenoir": "…but how? With someone who refuses to talk. We don’t even share the bonds of grief anymore. She walks her path and I walk mine. I don’t exist to her. None of us do. She’s left us all behind to drown by ourselves, so that she can drown alone…",
    "01_Aline_Aline": "…his little grin, so proud of his latest creation. But at least those memories remain. What hurts more are the memories unmade. The conversations we’ll never have, the time we’ll never spend. \n\nI want rage to consume me, anything to fill the hollow. But rage won’t come. I just float in an endless nothingness…\n\n…the person I cannot be around is Alicia. Her pain is a broken mirror, the shards reflecting back tenfold. Every moment with her, the cuts deepen, and I feel myself unravelling…\n\n…I know what he’ll say, but this is the first time I’ve felt any surcease. For a few moments a day, my heart beats again…",
    "01_RenoirReacher_RealRenoir": "…people come and people go, the one who will always be there for you is you. Little one, there’s more to life, if you can just see how big the sky truly is. Reach out your hand, and it’s yours…"
